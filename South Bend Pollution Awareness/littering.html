            <h2><u>Littering and how we can stop it!</u></h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent:25px"><b>Littering is a big, big, problem not only here in south bend, but around the world. Here are some facts and statistics about littering and its affects,</b></p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">-Statistics website research conducted August 25, 2016</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- 9 billion tons is the total amount of litter that is dumped into the ocean every year</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- 250 million tons of trash is generated in the US per year</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- $11.5 billion is the amount of of money spent on cleaning up litter a year</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- 33% of litter is Fast Food Waste</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- 29% of litter is paper</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- 28% of litter is Aluminum</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- 6% of litter is glass</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- 2% of litter is plastic</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- 2% of litter are other things</p> 
            <br>
             <img src="http://pugetsoundblogs.com/kitsap-crime/files/2009/03/239287935_77e5648891.jpg" hspace="20" alt="litter" style="position:right"/>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- Industrial waste often contains many toxic compounds that damage the health of aquatic animals and those who eat them.</p> 
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- Water pollution can disrupt and negatively impact nature's water cycle as well.</p> 
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- Pollution affects the entire food chain.</p> 
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- Weed and bug killers are toxic to fish in low concentrations resulting in fish mortality and a decline in fish populations.</p> 
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- Heavy metals in water stunt growth and impair a fish's sense of smell, which hampers its ability to find food or avoid predators.</p> 
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- These species living under polluted waters are deprived from their food source, which leads to starvation and finding a new habitat.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- When water in the atmosphere mixes with certain chemicals, in particularly those omitted from burning fossil fuels, acidic compounds are formed.</p> 
            <p style="text-indent:25px">- Through the discharge of toxic amounts of aluminum into the water, PH levels are altered, killing many animals outright and throwing delicate ecosystems out of balance.</p> 
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent:25px">Littering affects us all, either physically or mentally. Littering increases the cost of taxes to clean up the mess on the streets. Instead of a cleaning crew we could be using these taxes for better and safer roads or facilities to improve our city.Litter never stays in one location. Litter can travel along rivers, lakes, and seas. It can be taken by the wind and also get around by traffic. The increase in littering increases health problems such as anxiety, depression, heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and obesity.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent:25px"><b>Even though there are many problems with littering, there are also many ways to try and help stop littering.</b></p>
