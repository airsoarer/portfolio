            <h2><u>History of the St. Joseph River</u></h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The St. Joseph River(Sakiwasipi) also known as “La Riviere de Miamis”(River of the Miamis) is about 206 miles long(332 km). It is located in Southern Michigan and Northern Indiana in the US.  The River was extremely important to the Native Americans and greatly aided in the colonial exploration, settlement, and administration of New France and the US. It was a canoe route between Lake Michigan and the watershed of the Mississippi River.</p><br>
            <p>There are 190 dams in the St. Joseph River, as well as 17 on the River's mainstream. The River flows through Downtown South Bend. The abrupt turn in the River is what gives South Bend its name.
	Many factories were located in South Bend because of the East and West races that were held on the St. Joseph River. The River is inhabited with trout and salmon, making it a great spot for sport fishery.
